# arduino-lab
Original Arduino projects built from scratch.

## rgbColorController 
This project allows users to create custom RGB color combinations using a joystick interface.

## speedMonitorLCDDisplay
This project measures an object's speed using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the result on an LCD screen in real time.

## recordReactionTime
This project helps users track and improve their reaction time by pressing a push-button in response to an active buzzer. The buzzer is triggered at random intervals to prevent anticipation.

## simonShortTermMemoryGame
This project recreates the classic short-term memory game where users repeat an increasingly long sequence of LED flashes and sounds (tones on passive buzzer) using corresponding buttons. If the user makes a mistake while replicating the randomly generated sequence of LED flashes/sounds, a new round begins automatically, and the high score is saved and displayed on an LCD--not really original, but I played this game as a kid and thought it'd be a cool project.
